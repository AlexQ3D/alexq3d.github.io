			<h2> PSYCRON </h2>
			<div class="paragraphList">
				<ul>
					<li>TL;DR
					<ul>
						<li>A lo-fi metroidvania released in August of 2021 developed by me (Code & Art) and <a href="">Henry Hoffman (Sound, Music)</a></li>
						<li>Published on Steam, worked with Steamworks and Steam Pipe</li>
						<li>I was the programmer & designer, developed in GMS2 using GML</li>
						<li>Utilized Git and Github for version control, Trello for task and bug tracking</li>
						<li>Organized QA and testing through Discord, managed & recieved public feedback through Discord and Steam's support forms</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
<br>
				<li>In more detail:
					<ul>
						A Grade 12 capstone project which got way out of hand. I was responsible for designing and programming the game, along with getting it onto Steam using Valve's Steamworks platform. Since I was the sole programmer I also organized testing/QA.
						PSYCRON was developed in GMS2 and scripted/written in GML.
						
						<br><br>
						I created several tools for the game, including a custom audio mixer to make mastering easier which was useable in-game, updated in real time and saved mixing data to a .json file and a python program to autogenerate text similar to the logo from a custom spritefont.
						<br><br>
						Git and Github were invalueable during the project, as they allowed me to create easy backups & a seperate branch for a demo version of the game, so any demo specific changes could be kept separate from master.

						In early September after some rough doodles in Photoshop, I sat down and finally decided to properly set a portfolio up. I find it especially handy since I've done a lot of game related projects which benefit from the more visual nature 
						and lack of space restrictions. Plus, great practice with HTML and CSS!

			<h2> Skeletied </h2>
			<div class="paragraphList">
				<ul>
					<li>TL;DR
					<ul>
						<li>Entry with the SFU Game Developers club for the GMTK 2021 "Tied Together" gamejam</li>
						<li>Puzzle game about using a skeleton's two halves joined by his stretchy spine to solve puzzles</li>
						<li>Coded the menu system and some of the animations in Godot with GDScript</li>
						<li>Designed and drew the main character and logo, composed some of the music (Title Screen, Ending)</li>
						
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>In more detail:
					<ul>
						The SFU Game Developer club's entry to the GMTK 2021 gamejam made very quickly over two days. I had had the idea for a person who was split in half that could manipulate or carry objects to solve puzzles using their spine. 
						Gabe (the club's president) rightfully pointed out that it was a bit morbid so we made Skeletony instead.
						
						<br><br>
						
						I drew the skeleton and logo, came up with a few puzzle concepts(see image 2!), and was responsible for putting together a level select (which never ended up getting used, it was a gamejam surprise surprise) that got repurposed into the main menu. 
						Would have liked to have done more but was feeling pretty burned from trying to wrap up PSYCRON development.

			<h2> Vinyl Record Database </h2>
			<div class="paragraphList">
				<ul>
					<li>TL;DR
					<ul>
						<li>System for storing records on... vinyl records</li>
						<li>Console application, written in C++ 17 and split across multiple .cpp/.h files for faster compilation and readability</li>
						<li>Used a custom class to store each record, loaded in record information from an external file and able to sort by Artist Name/Length/etc.</li>
						<li>Program tested heavily with valgrind to catch any memory leaks</li>
						<li>Developed on a Linux VM (WSL) to speed up development compared to using a normal virtualbox install</li>
						
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<li>In more detail:
					<ul>
						My final project for CMPT 135 (Introduction to Programming II) where I was tasked to create some sort of a database system. I like vinyl records so I decided to make those the data.
						
						<br><br>
						
						This is one of the larger C++ programs I've worked on, being split across multiple files to both speed up recompilation and to keep everything readable. 
						Read in records externally from a text file, desgined a custom class to store information about records, 
						and used STL's sorting algorithms to order data by fields (Artist Name, Length, Year, etc...).

		<h2>Languages</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Comfortable with:</b> C++, HTML, CSS <br>
			<b>Some experience with:</b> Python, C#, C (Arduino Programming)
		
		</p>
		<h2>Software</h2>
		<p>
			I do most of my C++ coding in either Notepad++ or VS Code, but do have some experience with Visual Studio 2019 from small C++ experiments and writing a custom game engine in C# (Using MonoGame, XNA fork/successor).	
			<br><br>
			Since I haven't gotten around to setting up dualbooting yet, most of my C++ development happens on a Linux VM through WSL. I have experience using both that and Ubuntu 16.04.
			<br><br>
			All of my version control and backups for programming projects are done through Git with GitHub Desktop, though I have played around with using Git through the command line.
			<br><br>
			I'm also fairly proficient in the Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Premiere Pro) which I've used to make promotional graphics, diagrams, and trailers.
